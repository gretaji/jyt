I would like to take this opportunity to express my genuine gratitude to everyone involved, directly or indirectly, in supporting and helping me through this project.\\
\\
First of all, I would like to thank my academic supervisor Professor Stepan Lucyszyn for his precious time and excellent supervision. He consistently guides me to process my project and improves it through the meetings and emails. His patience and wide knowledge make this project possible.\\
\\
Secondly, I would also like to appreciate Dr William J. Otter, as the idea of this project is proposed by him. He also  takes time to guide my work on the 3D printer and extruder by showing me valuable opinions.\\
\\
Then I would like to thank the PhD students of my supervisor, including Attique Dawood, Jingye Sun and Hang Ren for their support. They show me how to use the equipment correctly in the laboratory and their suggestions are also helpful. \\
\\
Lastly, I would thank my classmates and my family for their support and encouragement.
